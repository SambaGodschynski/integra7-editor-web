# integra7-editor-web
A web version of the integra7 editor.

The original Integra-7 Editor is just a web page embedded into a VST-Plugin.
This project just uses those sources, adding some WebMidi stuff to get the editor to work in the browser.

## Starting the Editor
* if not happen yet, install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
* clone this project
* cd into the project folder
* open the cmd and execute `npx http-serve .`
